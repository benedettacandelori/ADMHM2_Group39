---

This repository is made up of 2 files:

1. `functions.py` 
    > It contains the functions that we created to solve the homework and it is imported at the top of the *main.ipynb* file.
2. `main.ipynb`
    > It contains all the answers to both research and theoretical questions of the homework which is based on the analysis of the dataset [steam_reviews.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021). It contains many features about Steam's reviews and our purpose is to understand and analyze the dataset and discover meaningful patterns in data.
